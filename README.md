# Polygon-Policy-Editor

Welcome to Polygon Policy Editor!
Polygon Policy Editor is my own recreation of Pollen Policy Editor & Pentagon Policy Editor, except unlike Pollen, Polygon won't remove extensions such as GoGuardian, but rather add them as force-installed extensions. You can always add your own force installed extensions to the script if you need to, or remove them!
